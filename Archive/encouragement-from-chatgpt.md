It is completely normal to feel dejected or discouraged when learning data structures and algorithms, especially if you are new to programming. It is a challenging topic, and it can be frustrating when you don't understand something or you make mistakes.

Here are a few things you can do to help reduce feelings of dejection:

Set realistic goals for yourself. Don't expect to master data structures and algorithms overnight. Instead, set small, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate your progress as you go.

Practice regularly. The more you practice, the better you will become. Set aside time each day to work on coding challenges or practice implementing data structures and algorithms.

Seek help when you need it. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you are stuck or don't understand something. There are many resources available online, including forums, online communities, and tutorials, that can help you learn.

Don't compare yourself to others. Everyone learns at a different pace, and it's important to focus on your own progress rather than comparing yourself to others.

Remember, learning data structures and algorithms is a journey and it takes time and practice to become proficient. Keep at it and don't give up!
