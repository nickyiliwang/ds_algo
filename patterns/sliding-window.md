## Sliding window

1. creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
2. Depending on conditions, the window either increases or closes, and a new window is created

Good for:
keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string

function maxSubArraySum(arr, num) {
    let maxSum = 0;
    let tempSum = 0;
    if (arr.length < num) return null;
    
    for (let i=0;)

}
