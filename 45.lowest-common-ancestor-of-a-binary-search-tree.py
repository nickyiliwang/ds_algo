# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


# Example 1:


# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
# -109 <= Node.val <= 109
# All Node.val are unique.
# p != q
# p and q will exist in the BST.
