#
# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if
# they are the same or not.
#
# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical,
# and the nodes have the same value.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
# Output: false
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
# Output: false
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
# -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
#
#
#


# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        stack = [[p, q]]

        while stack:
            p, q = stack.pop()

            if p and q and p.val == q.val:
                stack.append([p.left, q.left])
                stack.append([p.right, q.right])

            elif p or q:
                return False

        return True
