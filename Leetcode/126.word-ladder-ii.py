# A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a
# dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk
# such that:
# 
# 
# Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
# Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to
# be in wordList.
# sk == endWord
# 
# 
# Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all
# the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty
# list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list
# of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList =
# ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
# Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
# Explanation:Â There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
# "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
# "hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList =
# ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
# Output: []
# Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no
# valid transformation sequence.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
# endWord.length == beginWord.length
# 1 <= wordList.length <= 500
# wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
# beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
# beginWord != endWord
# All the words in wordList are unique.
# The sum of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed 10^5.
