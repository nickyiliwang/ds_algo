# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,5]\n11'
#
# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different
# denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
#
# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If
# that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins,
# return -1.
#
# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
# Output: -1
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= coins.length <= 12
# 1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
# 0 <= amount <= 10^4
#
#
#

            for c in coins:
                if a - c >= 0:
                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c])

        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float("inf") else -1
