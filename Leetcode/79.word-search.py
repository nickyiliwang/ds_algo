#
# Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if
# word exists in the grid.
# 
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells,
# where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
# letter cell may not be used more than once.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word
# = "ABCCED"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word
# = "SEE"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word
# = "ABCB"
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# m == board.length
# n = board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 6
# 1 <= word.length <= 15
# board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a
# larger board?
