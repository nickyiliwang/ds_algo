#
# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the
# reversed list.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively.
# Could you implement both?
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

            prev = curr
            curr = nextNode
