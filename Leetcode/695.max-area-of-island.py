#
# You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's
# (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You
# may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
#
# The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
#
# Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return
# 0.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: grid =
# [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected
# 4-directionally.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 50
# grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
#
