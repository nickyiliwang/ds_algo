#
# You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some
# are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
#
# Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty
# and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return trueÂ if n new flowers can be
# planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and
# false otherwise.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
# Output: false
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4
# flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
# There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
# 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
#
#
