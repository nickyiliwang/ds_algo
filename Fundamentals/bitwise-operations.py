# Operator	Name	Description	                                        Example
# & 	    AND	    Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	            x & y
# |	        OR	    Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	        x | y
# ^	        XOR	    Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	    x ^ y
# ~	        NOT	    Inverts all the bits	                            ~x
# <<	    Zero    fill left shift	Shift left
#                   by pushing zeros in from the right
#                   and let the leftmost bits fall off	                x << 2
# >>	    Signed  right shift	Shift right by pushing
#                   copies of the leftmost bit in from
#                   the left, and let the rightmost
#                   bits fall off	                                    x >> 2
