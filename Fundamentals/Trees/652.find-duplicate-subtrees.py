# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,null,2,4,null,null,4]'
#
# Given the rootÂ of a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees.
#
# For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of
# any one of them.
#
# Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with the same node
# values.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,2,4,null,null,4]
# Output: [[2,4],[4]]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,1,1]
# Output: [[1]]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,2,2,3,null,3,null]
# Output: [[2,3],[3]]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of the nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 5000]
# -200 <= Node.val <= 200
#

            # Any subsequent occurrences (third, fourth, etc.) will have a length greater than 1, but we are only interested in adding the subtree to the result list when we first identify it as a duplicate (i.e., the second occurrence).
            if len(counter[st]) == 1:
                res.append(node)
