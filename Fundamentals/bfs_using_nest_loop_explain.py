# Using the `while q` loop without the nested `for _ in range(len(q))` can fundamentally change how you process nodes in a BFS, particularly when dealing with level-by-level traversal or distance tracking in a graph or tree.

# ### Without the Nested Loop

# If you use just a single `while q` loop without the nested `for _ in range(len(q))`, you process nodes in a strict FIFO order but don't separate processing by levels. Here's what that looks like:

# ```python
# from collections import deque

# def bfs_without_levels(start_node):
#     q = deque([start_node])
#     visited = set([start_node])

#     while q:
#         current_node = q.popleft()
#         # Process the current node
#         for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_node):
#             if neighbor not in visited:
#                 visited.add(neighbor)
#                 q.append(neighbor)
# ```

# ### With the Nested Loop

# Using the nested `for _ in range(len(q))` loop ensures that you process all nodes at the current level before moving on to nodes at the next level. Here's a comparison:

# ```python
# from collections import deque

# def bfs_with_levels(start_node):
#     q = deque([start_node])
#     visited = set([start_node])
#     level = 0

#     while q:
#         level_size = len(q)
#         for _ in range(level_size):
#             current_node = q.popleft()
#             # Process the current node
#             for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_node):
#                 if neighbor not in visited:
#                     visited.add(neighbor)
#                     q.append(neighbor)
#         level += 1
#         # Process the level here if needed
# ```

# ### Key Differences

# 1. **Level Separation**:
#    - **With Nested Loop**: Nodes are processed level by level. This means you can do level-specific processing, such as tracking the distance from the starting node or collecting nodes for each level.
#    - **Without Nested Loop**: Nodes are processed in the order they are encountered. This can mix nodes from different levels, making it difficult to separate level-specific processing.

# 2. **Distance Tracking**:
#    - **With Nested Loop**: You can easily keep track of the distance or depth since each iteration of the outer `while` loop corresponds to processing nodes at a particular level.
#    - **Without Nested Loop**: You would need a more complex mechanism to track distances since the nodes aren't processed level by level.

# 3. **Algorithm Applications**:
#    - **With Nested Loop**: Suitable for problems where level or depth information is crucial, such as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, level-order traversal of a tree, or multi-source BFS.
#    - **Without Nested Loop**: Suitable for generic BFS where level or depth information is not necessary.

# ### Example Scenarios

# #### Level Order Traversal (With Nested Loop)

# ```python
# from collections import deque

# def level_order_traversal(root):
#     if not root:
#         return []

#     result = []
#     q = deque([root])

#     while
